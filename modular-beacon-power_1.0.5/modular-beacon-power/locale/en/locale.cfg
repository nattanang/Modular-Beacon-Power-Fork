modular-beacon-power=Modular Beacon Power

[mod-description]
modular-beacon-power=Beacons are affected by their own modules. Fully configurable settings.

[mod-setting-name]
mbp-description-details=Display % differences
mbp-negative-bonuses=Negative bonuses
mbp-positive-bonuses=Positive bonuses
mbp-entity-limit=Entity limit
mbp-apply-efficiency=Apply distribution efficiency
mbp-update-rate=Time between updates (ticks)
mbp-active-mod=Active mod

[mod-setting-description]
mbp-description-details=Shows the power consumption difference from modules as a percentage in beacon descriptions
mbp-negative-bonuses=Applies bonuses which reduce beacon power consumption (e.g. efficiency modules)
mbp-positive-bonuses=Applies bonuses which increase beacon power consumption (e.g. speed modules)\n[color=255,230,192]NOTICE:[/color] Positive bonuses have no upper limit so they have a larger impact on memory used when loading the game.
mbp-entity-limit=Prevents the mod from creating more than this many entities\n[color=255,230,192]NOTICE:[/color] Setting this too high could prevent the game from loading due to insufficient memory.
mbp-apply-efficiency=Module bonuses are multiplied by the beacon's distribution efficiency before affecting the beacon
mbp-update-rate=How often the game checks individual beacons to update their power consumption, in addition to triggered updates. Higher values will result in better performance, but will take longer to ensure accuracy.
mbp-active-mod=Beacons are updated normally.\nDisable to revert all beacons to their original entities, making it safe to uninstall the mod or change startup settings.
